# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

In the early practicals, my estimates were often inaccurate — I tended to underestimate how long a task 
would take, especially if it involved new libraries or unfamiliar concepts. I frequently ran over time 
when debugging or figuring out requirements.


### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, my estimates became more realistic. I started accounting for testing, documentation, and unexpected
problems. By the final few practicals, my actual times were usually within 10–20% of my estimates.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that estimating time is a skill that improves with experience. It forced me to break problems 
into smaller parts and think about the complexity of each one before starting. I also became more aware of 
how I spend time during coding tasks.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Thanks to others reviewing my code, I was able to improve it beyond what I had originally envisioned. 
For example, this included addressing issues such as inconsistent naming conventions and redundant logic. 
Reviewers often suggested simpler solutions to problems, which enhanced the readability and efficiency of 
my code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing other people's code allowed me to compare how my thinking differed from theirs and taught me 
how to read code more analytically. Being exposed to different approaches to the same task greatly helped 
me improve my own coding style.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[PR 1: Week 7 Guitars](https://github.com/kyumin7697/cp1404practicals/pull/4)

### Explanation

In this review, I gave feedback on both functionality and code structure. I pointed out a logic error 
in the `__lt__` method and also suggested better variable naming to improve clarity. The review was thorough
and included both praise and suggestions.


## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would include more short, optional video walkthroughs for trickier tasks (e.g., Flask, file I/O, or GUI design). 
Sometimes the written instructions weren't quite enough, and examples would help students understand 
the goals faster.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Although I still lack the ability to write cleanly structured code, taking this class has enabled me 
to understand the overall functioning of Python and coding, and based on this knowledge, I believe 
I have become better at looking at code and understanding how it works and what it is for.
