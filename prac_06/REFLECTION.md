# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

At first, I came up with the overall concept, created all the code according to that concept, 
and then conducted testing. However, after taking the class, I changed my approach to dividing the code into 
sections, committing each section, and conducting testing for each section.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to change my approach by reviewing the weekly content before the class rather than after.


## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

While conducting the practical training, whenever I encountered a line of code that I did not understand, 
I reviewed the materials again and made sure I understood it before moving on.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop leaving practical tasks until the last minute. This causes unnecessary stress and 
limits the time I have to understand the concepts properly.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Currently, the overall teaching methods and content seem to be very systematic and good. However, 
the grading criteria for code validity and conciseness are sometimes ambiguous or difficult to study. 
Usually, these criteria determine the detailed scores, so I feel a little stressed about them.
