# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

70%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

After finishing the morning online class, I watched the video at home before participating in the afternoon practical training.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I can create code that works well for its intended purpose. However, there is some unnecessary code and structure in the process, so this part needs to be improved.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I am still unfamiliar with committing, so rather than doing it frequently, I committed once after completing the entire task. It would be better to commit continuously throughout the process rather than doing it this way.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I'm not very good at naming functions and variables.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I believe that I am following the instructions given in class well. My goal is to do as much as I have learned.
